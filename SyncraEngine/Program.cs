        // automatic network synchronization, robust permissions handling, and runtime user
        // scripting enabling you to define new components.
        // You can hot-reload scripts that you write in C# or in SyncraFlow
        // (the visual node editor that gets compiled to C#).
        // C# scripts can be published as packages.
        // SyncraEngine always runs in a sandboxed context.
        // Each world is essentially its own SyncraEngine process instance.
        // Git is integrated into the package and asset system, enabling easy version control
        // and distribution of content.
