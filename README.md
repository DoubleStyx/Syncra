# Syncra

A game-engine engine with a focus toward networked VR and desktop use cases. Isomorphic to a butterfly.

The overall philosophy is to only use the minimum required libraries to conform to existing specifications. Anything that isn't a specification should be implemented directly.

The development strategy will be to heavily rely on existing libraries for prototyping and gradually prune them out with more custom implementations.

## Current Goals

- Networking
- VR and desktop support
- Efficient state synchronization
- Rendering
- ECS-style architecture
- Rust backend with C# scene logic
- Cross-platform support
- Standalone support
- Extensible architecture allowing different data models to be downloaded and used at runtime
- In-game scripting using a paradigm that has a graph-code isomorphism
- Physics
- Architectural inspirations from various topics in pure math, like type theory, category theory, and homotopy type theory
- In-game shader graphs, also with a graph-code isomorphism
- In-game asset creation tools
- Editor tools
- Multithreading
- Native plugin/mod support
- API and architecture documentation
- Asynchronous rendering
- Decentralized networking authority
- HDRP-like rendering specification
